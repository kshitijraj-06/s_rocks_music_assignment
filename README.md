## 🏗️ Architecture

This app uses the **MVVM** pattern for scalability and maintainability:

```

lib/
├── model/             # Data models
├── view/              # UI widgets and pages
├── viewmodel/         # GetX controllers
├── service/           # Firebase Firestore interactions
├── utils/             # Shared widgets, bottom nav bar
